            <p>Hello, my name is Tiago and I am from Brazil! I have many hobbies, I like
            playing sports, learning about other cultures (specially Japanese), playing card and
            board games, playing the guitar, the piano and singing! But one of my favorite
            things of all times is to learn about technology, and that's why I'm studying
            at BYU Pathway Worldwide! Nice to meet you all.
